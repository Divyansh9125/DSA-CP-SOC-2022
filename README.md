# DSA-CP-SOC-2022
This repositery contains all codes that I have written for this project

It is divided into two parts. 
1)  GFG
  It contains all solutions to problems on GFG portal related to the topic I have learnt. They are stored in .docx format with the title of the problem and the following code below it.
  
2)  CSES
  This contains solutions the problems on CSES website. They contain subfolders with name of topic which then contain the problems in .py or .cpp file. The starting part is written in python but I later switched to c++ as I realised that same algorithm took much more time on python.__
  
  I learnt about the following topics and did the problems with the following schedule.__
  Week 1 - Introduction__
  Week 2 -  Mathematics, Bit Magic__ 
  Week 3 - Recursion__  
  Week 4 - Arrays, Searching & Sorting__
