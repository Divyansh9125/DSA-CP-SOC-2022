# DSA-CP-SOC-2022
This repositery contains all codes that I have written for this project

It is divided into two parts. 
1)  GFG
  It contains all solutions to problems on GFG portal related to the topic I have learnt. They are stored in .docx format with the title of the problem and the following code below it.
  
2)  CSES
  This contains solutions the problems on CSES website. They contain subfolders with name of topic which then contain the problems in .py or .cpp file. The starting part is written in python but I later switched to c++ as I realised that same algorithm took much more time on python.
  I learnt about the following topics and did the problems with the following schedule.
  Week 1 - Introduction
  Week 2 -  Mathematics, Bit Magic 
  Week 3 - Recursion  
  Week 4 - Arrays, Searching & Sorting
  Week 5 - Midsems
  Week 6 - Matrix 
  Week 7 - Hashing
  Week 8 -  Stack, Queue
  Week 9 - Endsem preparation
  Week 10 - Endsems
  Week 11 - Deque
  Week 12 - Tree & Binary Tree
  Week 13 - Heap, Graph & Greedy
